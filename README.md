## Editing the Template

[How to Build a Personal Webpage from Scratch](https://rutar.org/writing/how-to-build-a-personal-webpage-from-scratch/)
by Alex Rutar, particularly the 
[Crash course in HTML and CSS](https://rutar.org/writing/how-to-build-a-personal-webpage-from-scratch/#crash-course-in-html-and-css) 
section.

## Sitemap (optional)

The file `sitemap.xml` helps search engines understand the structure of your site.
In this file, each instance of "WEBSITE" should be replaced
with the actual address where this website is being hosted.
See the [sitemaps protocol page](https://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html) for more details.

## Alternatives

The simplicity of the HTML/CSS source for this template is its strongest feature.
For something more slick or modern or sophisticated or complicated:

 - [Hoverboard](https://github.com/gdg-x/hoverboard) is beautiful but requires some tech know-how to setup. 

 - You can build something from scratch based on a 
 [GitHub Pages site with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) 
 or a template from [Pixelarity](https://pixelarity.com).
